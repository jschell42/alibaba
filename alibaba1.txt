PROSPECTUS SUMMARY

This summary may not contain all of the information that you should consider before investing in our ADSs. You should carefully read the entire prospectus, including “Risk Factors” and the financial statements, before making an investment decision.
Our Mission
Our mission is to make it easy to do business anywhere.
Our founders started our company to champion small businesses, in the belief that the Internet would level the playing field by enabling small enterprises to leverage innovation and technology to grow and compete more effectively in the domestic and global economies. Our decisions are guided by how they serve our mission over the long-term, not by the pursuit of short-term gains.
Our Business
We are the largest online and mobile commerce company in the world in terms of gross merchandise volume in 2013, according to industry sources. We operate our ecosystem as a platform for third parties, and we do not engage in direct sales, compete with our merchants or hold inventory.
We operate Taobao Marketplace, China’s largest online shopping destination, Tmall, China’s largest third-party platform for brands and retailers, in each case in terms of gross merchandise volume, and Juhuasuan, China’s most popular group buying marketplace by its monthly active users, in each case in 2013 according to iResearch. These three marketplaces, which comprise our China retail marketplaces, generated a combined GMV of RMB1,542 billion (US$248 billion) from 231 million active buyers and 8 million active sellers in the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. A significant portion of our customers have begun transacting on our mobile platform, and we are focused on capturing this opportunity. In the three months ended December 31, 2013, mobile GMV accounted for 19.7% of our GMV, up from 7.4% in the same period in the previous year.
In addition to our three China retail marketplaces, which accounted for 82.7% of our revenues in the nine months ended December 31, 2013, we operate Alibaba.com, China’s largest global online wholesale marketplace in 2013 by revenue, according to iResearch, 1688.com, our China wholesale marketplace, and AliExpress, our global consumer marketplace, as well as provide cloud computing services.
As a platform, we provide the fundamental technology infrastructure and marketing reach to help businesses leverage the power of the Internet to establish an online presence and conduct commerce with consumers and businesses. We have been a leader in developing online marketplace standards in China. Given the scale we have been able to achieve, an ecosystem has developed around our platform that consists of buyers, sellers, third-party service providers, strategic alliance partners, and investee companies. Our platform and the role we play in connecting buyers and sellers and making it possible for them to do business anytime and anywhere is at the nexus of this ecosystem. Much of our effort, our time and our energy is spent on initiatives that are for the greater good of the ecosystem and the various participants in it. We feel a strong responsibility for the continued development of the ecosystem and we take ownership for this development. Accordingly, we refer to this as “our ecosystem.”
Our ecosystem has strong self-reinforcing network effects that benefit our marketplace participants, who are invested in our ecosystem’s growth and success. Through this ecosystem, we have transformed how commerce is conducted in China and built a reputation as a trusted partner for the participants in our ecosystem.
We have made significant investments in proprietary technologies and infrastructure in order to support our growing ecosystem. Our technology and infrastructure allow us to harness the substantial volume of data generated from our marketplaces and to further develop and optimize the products and services offered on our platform.

Through, our related company, Alipay, we offer payment and escrow services for buyers and sellers, providing security, trust and convenience to our users. We take a platform approach to shipping and delivery by working with third-party logistics service providers through a central logistics information system operated by Zhejiang Cainiao Supply Chain Management Co., Ltd., or China Smart Logistics, our 48%-owned affiliate. Through our investment in UCWeb, we are able to leverage its expertise as a developer and operator of mobile web browsers to enhance our mobile offerings beyond e-commerce, such as general mobile search.
Our revenue is primarily generated from merchants through online marketing services (via Alimama, our proprietary online marketing platform), commissions on transactions and fees for online services. We also generate revenues through fees from memberships, value-added services and cloud computing services. In the nine months ended December 31, 2013, we generated revenue of RMB40.5 billion (US$6.5 billion) and net income of RMB17.7 billion (US$2.9 billion). Our fiscal year ends on March 31.

The Network Effect on and across Our Marketplaces
The interactions between buyers and sellers create network effects in that more merchants attract more consumers, and more consumers attract more merchants. In addition, our marketplaces are interconnected in that many buyers and sellers on one marketplace also participate in the activities on our other marketplaces, thereby creating a second-order network effect that further strengthens our ecosystem.
The chart below depicts this network effect dynamic in our ecosystem.
Buyers
•    Chinese consumers buy on Taobao Marketplace, Tmall and Juhuasuan
•    While browsing or searching on Taobao Marketplace, consumers see product listings from both Taobao Marketplace and Tmall
•    Global consumers buy on AliExpress
•    Global wholesalers buy on Alibaba.com
Retail sellers
•    Small sellers in China sell on Taobao Marketplace and AliExpress
•    Chinese brands sell on Taobao Marketplace, Tmall, Juhuasuan and AliExpress and global brands sell on Tmall Global
•    Sellers source products on 1688.com
Wholesale sellers
•    Chinese wholesalers and manufacturers supply retail merchants in China on 1688.com and global wholesale buyers on Alibaba.com
•    Chinese wholesalers and manufacturers supply directly to global consumers on AliExpress
•    Global wholesalers and manufacturers supply global wholesale buyers on Alibaba.com

Table of Contents
Our Market Opportunity
Our market opportunity is primarily driven by the following factors:
•
Our business benefits from the rising spending power of Chinese consumers. China’s real consumption in 2013 was 36.5% of total GDP, which is a rate that is significantly lower than that of other countries, such as the United States, which had a consumption penetration rate of 66.8% in 2013, according to Euromonitor International. We believe that growth in consumption will drive higher levels of online and mobile commerce.
•
China’s online shopping population is relatively underpenetrated. According to the China Internet Network Information Center, or CNNIC, China had the world’s largest Internet population with 618 million users as of December 31, 2013. According to CNNIC, China had 302 million online shoppers in 2013. We believe the number of online shoppers will increase, driven by continued growth in Internet users as well as by the higher percentage of Internet users making purchases online.
•
We believe that consumers are expanding the categories of products and services they are purchasing online, which will further increase online and mobile commerce activity.
•
We believe that the increased usage of mobile devices will make access to the Internet even more convenient, drive higher online shopper engagement and enable new applications. China has the world’s largest mobile Internet user base with 500 million users as of December 31, 2013, according to CNNIC, and mobile usage is expected to increase, driven by the growing adoption of mobile devices.
•
China’s offline retail market faces significant challenges due to few nationwide brick and mortar retailers, an underdeveloped physical retail infrastructure, limited product selection and inconsistent product quality. These challenges in China’s retail infrastructure, which we believe are particularly acute outside of tier 1 and 2 cities, are causing consumers to leapfrog the offline retail market in favor of online and mobile commerce.
•
China has an increasingly extensive and rapidly improving logistics infrastructure consisting of nationwide, regional and local delivery services. We believe that the rapid development of China’s distributed logistics infrastructure and nationwide express delivery networks has been driven in part by the growth of e-commerce and will continue to support the unique demands of consumers and merchants conducting e-commerce transactions on marketplaces.
Overall, online shopping, which represented 7.9% of total China consumption in 2013, is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 27.2% from 2013 to 2016, according to iResearch, as more consumers shop online and e-commerce spending per consumer increases.
Our Strengths
We believe that the following strengths contribute to our success and are differentiating factors that set us apart from our peers.
•
Management Team with Owner Mentality and Proven Track Record. Our management team’s clear sense of mission, long-term focus and commitment to the values that define the Alibaba culture have been central to our successful track record. Our management team has created and grown leading businesses organically, including Taobao Marketplace, Tmall, Alibaba.com, Alibaba Cloud Computing and our related company Alipay.
•
Trusted Brands. Alibaba, Taobao, Tmall and Alipay are well recognized and trusted brands in China. Due to the strength of these brands, a majority of our customers navigate directly to our China retail marketplaces to find the products and services they are seeking instead of via third-party search engines.
•
Thriving Ecosystem with Powerful Network Effects. We are the steward of a thriving ecosystem, which provides us with the following key advantages:
•
participants in our ecosystem are invested in its success and growth;
5
Table of Contents
•
interactions among participants create value for one another as our ecosystem expands and generates strong network effects; and
•
the scope of our ecosystem and the network effects it creates, including the significant buyer traffic generated by our Taobao Marketplace, provide low-cost organic traffic for our other marketplaces and services and significantly reduce our reliance on a sales force for our marketing services.
•
Mobile Leadership. We are the leader in mobile commerce in China in terms of mobile retail GMV, with mobile GMV transacted on our China retail marketplaces accounting for 76.2% of total mobile retail GMV (excluding virtual items) in China in the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, according to iResearch. Our Mobile Taobao App has been the most popular mobile commerce app in China by mobile MAUs every month since August 2012, according to iResearch.
•
Scalable Logistics Platform. We offer sellers on our marketplaces the benefits of a distributed and scalable logistics platform and information system to provide high quality delivery services to sellers and buyers on a large scale. Our platform approach helps to address the requirements of facilitating the delivery of packages across a wide range of product categories from millions of sellers to millions of buyers in dispersed locations across China. The scalability of this network was demonstrated by its success in handling of 156 million packages generated on our Singles Day promotion in 2013 compared to a daily average of 13.7 million packages generated from transactions on our China retail marketplaces in 2013.
•
Reliable, Scalable and Cost-effective Proprietary Technology. We have developed proprietary technology that is reliable, scalable and cost-effective. Our technology is designed to handle the large volume of transactions on our marketplaces. For example, we successfully processed 254 million orders within 24 hours during our Singles Day promotion on November 11, 2013.
•
Data Insights. Data from consumer behavior and transactions completed on our marketplaces and interactions among participants in our ecosystem provide us with valuable insights to help us and our sellers improve the buyer experience, operate more efficiently and create innovative products and services.
•
Third-party Platform Business Model. Our exclusively third-party platform business model allows us to scale rapidly without the risks and capital requirements of sourcing, merchandising and holding inventory borne by direct sales companies. This business model drives our profitability and strong cash flow, which give us the flexibility to further invest in and improve our platform, expand our ecosystem and aggressively invest in people, technology, innovative products and strategically important assets.
Our Strategies
The key elements of our strategy to grow our business include:
•
Increase Active Buyers and Wallet Share. In 2013, the average active buyer on our China retail marketplaces placed 49 orders, up from 39 orders in 2012 and 33 orders in 2011. We will continue to develop and market the value proposition of our retail marketplaces to attract new buyers as well as to increase the wallet share of existing buyers through more frequent buying and buying across more product categories. We intend to achieve growth through customer loyalty programs, high quality customer service, marketing and promotional campaigns, and expansion of marketing affiliates, as well as by promoting the usage of our various mobile commerce apps such as our Mobile Taobao App.
•
Expand Categories and Offerings. We aim to enhance the shopping experience for consumers, increase consumer engagement and create additional opportunities for merchants by developing and promoting additional categories and offerings. We believe that growth in the number of product and service categories and products and services purchased within each category contributes to higher average spending per customer and increases GMV.
6
Table of Contents
•
Extend Our Mobile Leadership. We intend to build upon our strength in mobile commerce to develop a broader spectrum of consumer offerings, such as location-based services, O2O services and digital content, in order to fulfill our vision of becoming central to the everyday lives of our customers. We will also continue to look for ways to increase our mobile user base and engagement through strategic alliances, investments and acquisitions.
•
Enhance the Success of Sellers on a Broad Basis. We aim to increase the success of a broad base of sellers on our marketplaces by increasing their exposure to relevant buyer demand and providing them with more tools such as data science applications to manage their relationships with customers.
•
Enhance Data and Cloud Computing Technologies. We will continue to implement our data strategy through the application of data intelligence and deep learning technologies to several fields, including marketplace design, user interface, search, targeted marketing, logistics, location-based services and financial services, among others. In addition, we will continue to invest heavily in our cloud computing platform to support our own businesses and those of third parties.
•
Develop Cross-border Commerce Opportunities. Our international strategy is focused on leveraging natural cross-border linkages to our ecosystem. For example, we will continue to grow our international business by connecting overseas branded retailers to Chinese consumers (Tmall Global), connecting Chinese suppliers to international retail markets (AliExpress) and international wholesale markets (Alibaba.com).
Alibaba Partnership
Since our founders first gathered in Jack Ma’s apartment in 1999, they and our management have acted in the spirit of partnership. We view our culture as fundamental to our success and our ability to serve our customers, develop our employees and deliver long-term value to our shareholders. In July 2010, in order to preserve this spirit of partnership and to ensure the sustainability of our mission, vision and values, we decided to formalize this partnership as Lakeside Partners, named after the “Lakeside Gardens” residential community where Jack and our other founders started our company. We refer to the partnership as the Alibaba Partnership.
We believe that our partnership approach has helped us to better manage our business, with the peer nature of the partnership enabling senior managers to collaborate and override bureaucracy and hierarchy. The Alibaba Partnership currently has 28 members comprised of 22 members of our management and six members of the management of our related companies and affiliates. The partnership operates under principles, policies and procedures that have evolved with our business and are described below.
Our partnership is a dynamic body that rejuvenates itself through admission of new partners each year, ensuring excellence, innovation and sustainability. Unlike dual-class ownership structures that employ a high-vote class of shares to concentrate control in a few founders, our approach is designed to embody the vision of a large group of management partners. This structure is our solution for preserving the culture shaped by our founders while at the same time accounting for the fact that founders will inevitably retire from the company.
•
New partners are elected annually after a nomination process based on a number of criteria including, in most cases, not less than five years of tenure, and that require a 75% approval of all of the partners. Partnership votes are made on a one-partner-one-vote basis.
•
Partners are evangelists for our mission, vision and values, both within our organization and externally to customers, business partners and other participants in our ecosystem.
•
We require each partner to maintain a meaningful level of equity interests in our company during such individual’s tenure as a partner.
7
Table of Contents
•
The Alibaba Partnership will have the exclusive right to nominate for shareholder approval a simple majority of the members of our board of directors. If an Alibaba Partnership director nominee is not elected by our shareholders or departs our board of directors for any reason, the Alibaba Partnership has the right to appoint a different person to serve as an interim director until our next scheduled annual general meeting of shareholders.
Our Challenges
We believe some of the major risks and uncertainties that may materially and adversely affect us include the following:
•
any failure to maintain the trusted status of our ecosystem could severely damage our reputation and brand;
•
we may not be able to maintain or improve the network effects of our ecosystem;
•
our operating philosophy may negatively influence our short-term financial performance;
•
we may not be able to successfully monetize our mobile traffic;
•
we may not be able to maintain our culture, which has been a key to our success;
•
we may not be able to innovate or compete effectively;
•
if the services Alipay provides to us are limited or restricted, our business would be harmed;
•
we may not be able to sustain our revenue growth rate, and increased investments in our business may negatively affect our margins;
•
our revenue and net income may be materially and adversely affected by any economic slowdown in China as well as globally;
•
there are risks and uncertainties associated with our variable interest entity structure; and
•
the regulatory and legal system in China is complex and developing, and future regulations may impose additional requirements on our business.
We also face other challenges, risks and uncertainties that may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. You should consider the risks discussed in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this prospectus before investing in our ADSs.

Alibaba Group Holding Limited is a Cayman Islands holding company established on June 28, 1999, and we conduct our business in China through our subsidiaries and variable interest entities.
Due to PRC legal restrictions on foreign ownership and investment in, among other areas, value-added telecommunications services, which include Internet content providers, or ICPs, we, similar to all other entities with foreign-incorporated holding company structures operating in our industry in China, operate our Internet businesses and other businesses in which foreign investment is restricted or prohibited in the PRC through wholly-foreign owned enterprises, majority-owned entities and variable interest entities. The relevant variable interest entities, which are 100% owned by PRC citizens or by PRC entities owned by PRC citizens, hold the ICP licenses and operate the various websites for our Internet businesses. Specifically, our variable interest entities are generally majority-owned by Jack Ma, our lead founder, executive chairman and one of our principal shareholders, and minority-owned by Simon Xie, one of our founders and a member of our management. These contractual arrangements collectively enable us to exercise effective control over, and realize substantially all of the economic risks and benefits arising from, the variable interest entities. See “Our History and Corporate Structure — Contractual Arrangements among Our Wholly-foreign Owned Enterprises, Variable Interest Entities and the Variable Interest Entity Equity Holders.” The contractual arrangements may not be as effective in providing operational control as direct ownership. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure.”
As a result, we include the financial results of each of the variable interest entities in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, as if they were our wholly-owned subsidiaries.
Other than the ICP licenses and other licenses and approvals for businesses in which foreign ownership is restricted or prohibited held by our variable interest entities, we hold our material assets in, and conduct our material operations through, our wholly-foreign owned and majority foreign owned enterprises, which primarily provide technology and other services to our customers. We generate the significant majority of our revenue directly through our wholly-foreign owned enterprises, which directly capture the profits and associated cash flow from operations without having to rely on contractual arrangements to transfer such cash flow from the variable interest entities to the wholly-foreign owned enterprises.

We may amend or terminate the deposit agreement for any reason without your consent. Any amendment that imposes or increases fees or charges or which materially prejudices any substantial existing right you have as an ADS holder will not become effective as to outstanding ADSs until 30 days after notice of the amendment is given to ADS holders. If an amendment becomes effective, you will be bound by the deposit agreement as amended if you continue to hold your ADSs.
To better understand the terms of the ADSs, you should carefully read the section in this prospectus entitled “Description of American Depositary Shares.” We also encourage you to read the deposit agreement, which is an exhibit to the registration statement that includes this prospectus.

In the nine months ended December 31, 2013, these expenses included an equity-settled donation expense of RMB1,269 million (US$204 million) relating to the grant of options to purchase 50,000,000 of our ordinary shares to a non-profit organization designated by Jack Ma and Joe Tsai.

We entered into the Technology and Intellectual Property Licensing Agreement with Yahoo, or the Yahoo TIPLA, in October 2005, pursuant to which we pay royalty fees to Yahoo. We and Yahoo amended the existing TIPLA in September 2012, pursuant to which we made a lump sum payment in the amount of US$550 million, which is reflected as US$561 million in the convenience translation in the table above as a result of the change in the Renminbi to U.S. dollar exchange rate since the date of payment.

See “— Non-GAAP Measures” below.
Non-GAAP Measures
We use the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income from operations, adjusted net income and free cash flow in evaluating our operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes.
We believe that adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income from operations and adjusted net income help identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of the expenses that we exclude in adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income from operations and adjusted net income. We believe that adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income from operations and adjusted net income provide useful information about our operating results, enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making.
We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by our business that can be used for strategic corporate transactions, including investing in our new business initiatives, making strategic investments and acquisitions and strengthening our balance sheet. We use free cash flow to manage our business, make planning decisions, evaluate our performance and allocate resources. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of
15
Table of Contents
financial performance is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for a reporting period.
Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income from operations, adjusted net income and free cash flow should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to net income, cash flows or any other measure of performance or as an indicator of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income from operations, adjusted net income and free cash flow presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to our data.
Adjusted EBITDA represents income from operations (which excludes interest and investment income (loss), net, interest expense, other income, net, income tax expenses and share of results of equity investees) before (i) certain non-cash expenses, consisting of share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, depreciation and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets as well as (ii) one-time expense items consisting of the Yahoo TIPLA amendment payment and an equity-settled donation expense that we do not believe are reflective of our core operating performance during the period presented.
Adjusted income from operations represents income from operations (which excludes interest income and investment income (loss), net, interest expense, other income, net, income tax expenses and share of results of equity investees) before share-based compensation expense, one-time expense items consisting of the Yahoo TIPLA amendment payment and an equity-settled donation expense that we do not believe are reflective of our core operating performance during the period presented.
Adjusted net income represents net income before share-based compensation expense, one-time expense items consisting of the Yahoo TIPLA amendment payment, as well as an equity-settled donation expense.
Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities as presented in our consolidated cash flow statement less purchases of property and equipment (excluding acquisition of land use rights for, and construction of, our office campuses in China) and intangible assets, adjusted for changes in loan receivables relating to micro loans of our SME loan business and the Yahoo TIPLA amendment payment. We present the adjustment for changes in loan receivables because such receivables are reflected under cash flow from operating activities, whereas the secured borrowings and other bank borrowings used to finance them are reflected under cash flows from financing activities, and accordingly, the adjustment is made to show cash flows from operating activities net of the effect of changes in loan receivables.
